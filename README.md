# Robotelier ‚Äì Part 1: 555 Timer Simulation

This is **Part 1** of the **Robotelier** project ‚Äî an ongoing exploration of electronics, automation, and robotics.  
The first stage focuses on simulating a **555 timer in astable mode** using **LTspice** to generate a periodic square wave signal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

The **555 timer IC** is configured in **astable mode**, producing a continuous pulse train that can serve as a basic clock or signal source for later Robotelier modules.  
This circuit forms the foundation for future experiments in timing, control, and signal generation.
